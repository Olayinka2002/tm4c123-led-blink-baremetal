# TM4C123 LED Blink & Button Interrupt Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic **GPIO control**, **SysTick timer delays**, and **interrupt-driven input** on the TM4C123 microcontroller.  
An external LED is connected to **PA3**, and a push button is connected to **PD5**. Pressing the button toggles the LED using an **interrupt**, rather than polling.

## Hardware
- TM4C123GH6PM LaunchPad  
- 1x LED (with 220 Î© series resistor)  
- Jumper wires and breadboard  

**Connections:**  
| Component | Pin |
|-----------|-----|
| LED       | PA3 |

## Features
-Simple introduction to the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller
- Configures **PA3 as digital output** for LED.     
- Demonstrates **toggle logic**: LED switches state on each button press.  
- Includes **blocking delay using SysTick timer** for potential timing functions.

## Code Structure
//Main.c -> LED pin initialization. Led toggle function which toggles the pin from 1 to 0 continuously with a delay of 500ms in between using polling
//Led.c -> LED Pin declaration function: PA3 used as output wihout any alternate function implementation. The file also includes the toggle function which simply toggles the pin from 1 to 0
